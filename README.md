# helios-launcher

Graphical launcher for the [Heidelberg LiDAR Operations Simulator (HELIOS++)](https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/gis/helios.html)

You need a working installation of HELIOS++ from [GitHub](https://github.com/3dgeo-heidelberg/helios/releases).

Some settings like the HELIOS++ base directory, survey path or optional arguments are saved between sessions. These settings are stored as an *.ini
configuration file in the default QSettings directory:
- For Linux, this is usually '_~/.config/heliospp/helios-launcher.ini_'
- For Windows, this is usually '_C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\heliospp\helios-launcher.ini_'
