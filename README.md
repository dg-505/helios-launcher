# helios-launcher

Graphical launcher for the Heidelberg LiDAR Operations Simulator (HELIOS++)

Some settings like the HELIOS++ base directory are saved between sessions. These settings are stored as an *.ini
configuration file in the default QSettings directory:
- For Linux, this is usually '_~/.config/heliospp/helios-launcher.ini_'
- For Windows, this is usually '_C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\heliospp\helios-launcher.ini_'
